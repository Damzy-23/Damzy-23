👋 Hi, I'm Oluwadamilola Onasanya — a second-year Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence student at the University of the West of England.

💻 I'm passionate about using tech to solve real-world problems, especially in AI, automation, and data-driven applications.

🛠️ Some of my personal projects include:

🧠 An AI-powered personal assistant that sets reminders, answers questions, checks the weather, and more.

🎵 A recommendation system for books, music, and movies using collaborative and content-based filtering.

🗣️ A sentiment analysis tool that classifies text as positive, negative, or neutral.

🌱 The Sustainable Living Assistant app, which helps users adopt eco-friendly habits by providing personalized tips and tracking sustainable practices.

🔍 Currently exploring: Python, C++, SQL, machine learning models, and software development best practices.

🚀 Open to internships, collaborations, and learning opportunities in tech!
